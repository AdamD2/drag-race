This is an adaptation of the Atari 2600 game 'Dragster' by activision.

The goal of the game is to race to the finish line in the lowest possible time 
by changing up gears with good timing. Don't rev up too high though, or you'll
blow the engine!

You will need to have the pygame module installed to run the program from the
source code.
